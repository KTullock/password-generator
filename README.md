# Password Generator

## Description

This project serves to provide the user with a random password based on the qualifications the user inputs into the prompts. This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For this projected, I wrote the JavaScript and learned how to propmt the user with various questions about their password requirements. Once the user answers all of the questions, a random password is generated that meets all the criteria. I also learned how to use variables, functions, arrays, conditional statements, and iterations.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this website, click the red "Generate Password" button and answer the prompts about your password requirements. Once all of the questions are answered, the new password will generate on the page.
